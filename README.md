## Project Goals
- Provide organisations with a safe, structured way to purchase and access licensed digital resources.  
- Automate the end-to-end process: registration, license code generation, invoicing, payment, and access.  
- Reduce manual effort for administrators, ensure transparency, and support scalability for future resource expansion.  

---

## System Workflow
1. **Organisation Registration:**  
   The organisation submits an online registration form expressing interest.  

2. **Admin Review & Pricing:**  
   Admin is notified via email, reviews the registration, and sets a license price using the invoice dashboard.  

3. **Invoice Generation:**  
   An automated invoice email is sent to the organisation containing the license code and payment link.  

4. **Organisation Login:**  
   The organisation logs in using its **name** and **license code**.  

5. **Stripe Payment:**  
   Payment is processed securely via Stripe Checkout.  

6. **Resource Access:**  
   Upon successful payment, the organisation gains instant access to licensed resources and learning modules.  

---

## Key Features
- Automated license code generation (e.g., MH0001, MH0002).  
- Admin dashboard for invoice management and payment tracking.  
- Secure organisation login using license code validation.  
- Stripe Checkout integration ensuring PCI DSS compliance.  
- Immediate access to licensed resources post-payment.  
- Email automation for both admin and organisation notifications.  

---

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** WordPress pages built with Elementor and custom HTML shortcodes.  
- **Backend:** PHP with WordPress hooks and actions for database operations and session handling.  
- **Database:** WordPress MySQL table for storing organisation data and payment status.  
- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe Checkout (session-based payment confirmation).  
- **Security Layers:** PHP sessions (HttpOnly, strict mode), CSRF token validation, HTTPS-enforced communication.  

---

## Security & Quality Assurance
- **Form Protection:** All forms use CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery.  
- **Data Sanitisation:** Inputs cleaned with `sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_email`, and `sanitize_textarea_field`.  
- **Session Control:** Access-controlled pages verify active session variables (`$_SESSION['lic_org_id']`).  
- **Transport Security:** All data transmitted over HTTPS; payments handled by Stripeâ€™s secure API.  
- **Testing:** User Acceptance Testing (UAT) completed with sponsor before deployment.

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Add Code to Your WordPress Theme
- Create WordPress pages and insert the provided HTML or shortcodes where required.  
- Copy the PHP code from this repository into your WordPress **child theme** `functions.php` via:  
  **Dashboard â†’ Appearance â†’ Theme File Editor â†’ functions.php**

---

## Stripe Integration

### Step 1: Install Stripe PHP SDK  
- Download the official Stripe PHP SDK from GitHub:  
  ðŸ”— [https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php)  
- Upload the SDK folder to your WordPress environment and include it in your theme or install it as a plugin.  

### Step 2: Configure Stripe in WordPress  
- Test using **Stripe Test Mode**, then switch to **Live Mode** once verified.  
- Find your API keys in **Stripe Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ API Keys**.  
- Add your secret key and callback URLs in `functions.php`:  

```php
define('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'sk_live_****************');
define('STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL', home_url('/completed-payment/'));
define('STRIPE_CANCEL_URL', home_url('/org-dashboard/'));
```

### Step 3: Enable Real-Time Payments  
- Use **live account keys** to make the payment system work in real-time.  
- Ensure all transactions are done through HTTPS.
